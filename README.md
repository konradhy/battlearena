# Project Overview

A turn-based multiplayer game where you fight against AI or challenge a friend.

This project showcases the integration of gaming with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the user experience and game functionality. My goal was to explore three ways gaming can elevate AI's capabilities:

## NPC Behavior Control

- Utilizing AI to dynamically control Non-Player Character (NPC) behavior, making the game environment more interactive and engaging.

## Dynamic Text Generation

- Leveraging AI to generate unique and custom text responses based on the current state of the game, enriching the storytelling and player immersion.

## Learning and Incentivization

- Introducing a learning component within the game that incentivizes positive gaming habits and strategies through AI-driven feedback and rewards.
